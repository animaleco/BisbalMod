# DeathSoundEffect

A mod that adds a death sound effect

The death sound effect is an audio of streamer named Nissaxter crying out of frustration during a LoL game.

Installation:

* Install BepInEx

* Download the mod .zip and extract it into your game's root folder. It should look like:
/BepInEx/plugins/DeathSoundEffect/DeathSoundEffect.dll (The Cry.ogg will be there too)

Usage:


* Once the mod is installed, launch the game.

* If you die the sound effect will play

Enjoy!
