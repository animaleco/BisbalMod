# CustomSong

A mod that plays a sound file when the player moves.

I made this mod just for fun, as practice to learn programming.

Installation:

* Install BepInEx

* Download the mod .zip and extract it into your game's root folder. It should look like:
/BepInEx/plugins/CustomSong/CustomSong.dll

Usage:

*  Once the mod is installed, launch the game.

* A config file will be created at:
<GameFolder>/BepInEx/config/CustomSong.cfg

* Open it and change the SongPath to the location of the song or sound you want to use, e.g.:
C:\Users\YourUser\Music\Filename.ogg

* IMPORTANT: The file must be .ogg. You can use an online converter.

Enjoy!
